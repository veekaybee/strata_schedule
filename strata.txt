Summary:Why should I trust you? Explaining the predictions of machine-learning models 
Description: Presented by Carlos Guestrin (Dato). Despite widespread adoption, machine-learning models remain mostly black boxes, making it very difficult to understand the reasons behind a prediction. Such understanding is fundamentally important to assess trust in a model before we take actions based on a prediction or choose to deploy a new ML service. Carlos Guestrin offers a general approach for explaining predictions made by any ML model.
