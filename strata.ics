SUMMARY:Why should I trust you? Explaining the predictions of machine-le
 arning models
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Carlos Guestrin (Dato). Despite widespread adop
 tion, machine-learning models remain mostly black boxes, making it very 
 difficult to understand the reasons behind a prediction. Such understand
 ing is fundamentally important to assess trust in a model before we take
  actions based on a prediction or choose to deploy a new ML service. Car
 los Guestrin offers a general approach for explaining predictions made b
 y any ML model.

SUMMARY:Apache Kafka: The rise of real-time data and stream processing
DESCRIPTION:Presented by Neha Narkhede (Confluent). Neha Narkhede explai
 ns how Apache Kafka serves as a foundation to streaming data application
 s that consume and process real-time data streams and introduces Kafka C
 onnect, a system for capturing continuous data streams, and Kafka Stream
 s, a lightweight stream processing library. Neha also describes the less
 ons companies like LinkedIn learned building massive streaming data arch
 itectures.
